# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Deploying to Netlify

This application is configured for easy deployment to Netlify. Follow these steps to deploy:

### Option 1: Deploy via Netlify UI

1. Create a Netlify account at [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect to your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
4. Select your repository
5. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `build`
6. Configure environment variables in the Netlify dashboard:
   - REACT_APP_API_URL: URL to your backend API
   - REACT_APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY: Your encryption key (keep this secure)
7. Click "Deploy site"

### Option 2: Deploy via Netlify CLI

1. Install Netlify CLI: `npm install -g netlify-cli`
2. Run the deploy script: `./deploy.sh`
3. Authenticate with Netlify: `netlify login`
4. Initialize your site: `netlify init`
5. Deploy your site: `netlify deploy --prod`

### Important Notes

- The backend API must be deployed separately (e.g., to Heroku, AWS, etc.)
- Update the REACT_APP_API_URL in the Netlify environment variables to point to your deployed backend
- The netlify.toml file handles SPA routing for React Router
